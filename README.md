**Windows users** will also have to build or download poppler for Windows.<br>
Download here: https://github.com/oschwartz10612/poppler-windows/releases/<br>
After you unpack it, add the "bin/" folder to PATH<br>

### FOR EVERYONE:<br>
You can adjust the threshold by changing **the first number in brackets in line 39** (*with higher values more content will result black*)<br>
