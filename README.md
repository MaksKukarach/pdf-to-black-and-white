![Before1.png](images/sample1before.png "Before") **-->** ![After1.png](images/sample1after.png "After")
![Before2.png](images/sample2before.png "Before") **-->** ![After2.png](images/sample2after.png "After")

### When opened for the first time:<br>
    $ pip install pdf2img  
    $ pip install img2pdf  
    $ pip install opencv-python  

**Windows users** will also have to build or download poppler for Windows.<br>
Download here: https://github.com/oschwartz10612/poppler-windows/releases/<br>
After you unpack it, add the "bin/" folder to PATH<br>
How to add folders to PATH: https://www.architectryan.com/2018/03/17/add-to-the-path-on-windows-10/<br>

### FOR EVERYONE:<br>
You can adjust the threshold by changing **the first number in brackets in line 39** (*with higher values more content will result black*)<br>
I am glad to recieve your feedback about this project.<br>
**Enjoy :3**
